# The POD Model: An Agile Approach to Team-Based Project Management

The POD is a project management approach that organizes small, cross-functional teams to deliver products and solutions to market. This model is designed for internal project managers, team members, and stakeholders who are interested in a flexible, collaborative project management framework. It promotes flexibility and fluidity, enabling team members to efficiently handle multiple projects at once. The term "POD" also refers to the team itself.

## POD Benefits

The POD framework offers several key benefits that enhance project delivery and team dynamics.

### Collaboration

Within a POD, every project is a collaborative effort from start to finish. This ensures that each team member is familiar with the client's needs and can provide input on how to best carry out an implementation from the very beginning. This high level of collaboration significantly reduces the potential for miscommunication and unexpected issues.

### Synchronous Task Management

While team members still have their individual responsibilities, the collaborative nature of the POD empowers them to begin tasks as soon as a project is initiated. The close cooperation within a POD breaks down communication barriers, which reduces the impact of dependencies. POD members are encouraged to work in parallel on tasks whenever possible and do not need to wait for a formal go-ahead.

### Cohesion

Teams that work closely to deliver for clients develop a strong chemistry, giving the POD a cohesive nature that provides a number of intangible benefits. POD members regularly help each other with tasks across different areas of focus, such as Consultation, Integrations, and Configurations. This is possible because all team members are involved throughout the entire project lifecycle. This cohesion also extends to projects that require the specialized skills of individual POD members, as they can still count on their teammates for support. The collaborative spirit of the POD also positively impacts relationships with other departments, such as Support, QA, and Product.

## POD Team and Roles

The core focus of a POD is efficient delivery. A POD team can be made up of any small group of individuals with complementary skillsets. The POD framework utilizes specific roles tied to focused areas of delivery within any given project. For a common implementation project, the areas of delivery would be Consultation, Integrations, and Configurations. Each of these areas has a **POD Leader** role and a **POD Support** role attached to it.

If a POD consists of a Solutions Consultant, an Integrations Manager, and a Configurations Manager, each person will act as the Leader for the focus area that aligns with their specific skills. They will also take on a Support role for the other focus areas.

The **POD Leader** responsibilities will be familiar to the team members. For a newly initiated project, the Solutions Consultant would naturally lead the client consultation, as that is the first area of focus. The other team members—the Integrations Manager and Configurations Manager—will have their own POD Leader roles to play later in the project.

Simultaneously, these team members will also have **POD Support** roles. This might involve sitting in on client consultations from the beginning, which allows them to offer their input and begin to anticipate the tasks they will be responsible for as POD Leaders. The POD Support roles are critical to the POD's efficiency, as they empower members to fill in for one another or pitch in to help get a high-priority project to market more quickly. The Leader and Support roles, which rely on the empowerment of individual team members, allow PODs to effectively manage multiple projects.

## POD in Action: A Sample Model

To illustrate how a POD handles a typical implementation project, we can look at a model that outlines the roles and responsibilities during different phases. This is a model, not a strict directive, as PODs are designed to be flexible and adaptable.

### Consultation Tasks

The objective of this phase is to define and document the client's requirements and workflow to establish the project scope.

- **POD Leader**: Solutions Consultant
  - Responsibilities include leading client communications and the overall effort to define the project scope.
- **POD Support**: Integrations Manager and Configurations Manager
  - Responsibilities include supporting the Solutions Consultant and anticipating their own future tasks based on the developing project scope.

### Integrations Tasks

The objective is to define and document the integration approach and requirements.

- **POD Leader**: Integrations Manager
  - Responsibilities include leading client communications to determine the best integration strategy, ensuring the client is prepared for their integration responsibilities, and coordinating testing.
- **POD Support**: Solutions Consultant and Configurations Manager
  - Responsibilities include supporting the Integrations Manager, providing project oversight, and continuing tasks related to their own areas of focus.

### Configurations Tasks

The objective is to define and execute the configuration strategy.

- **POD Leader**: Configurations Manager
  - Responsibilities include leading client communications to ensure the best configuration strategy, leading intra-POD collaboration on this strategy, setting up system accounts, and onboarding users with the correct configurations.
- **POD Support**: Integrations Manager and Solutions Consultant
  - Responsibilities include supporting the Configurations Manager and continuing with tasks related to their own objectives.
